    question: "How do imports work?",
    answer: "Playwright MCP logs in securely, pulls rosters, scoring settings, and lineups. You can re-sync anytime with one click.",
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate are projections?",
    answer: "We blend historical performance, matchup analytics, and real-time news. Expect updates every 15 minutes and a full audit trail.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you store my credentials?",
    answer: "No. Credentials pass through secure MCP sessions and are never persisted on our servers.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I cancel anytime?",
    answer: "Yes. Stop your subscription inside the app. Your data stays available through the end of your billing cycle.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who do I contact for support?",
    answer: "Message us in-app or email support@glassgrid.com. We respond within one business day during the season.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you support custom scoring?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Import multiple scoring profiles and weâ€™ll mirror them in projections and optimizer outputs.",
