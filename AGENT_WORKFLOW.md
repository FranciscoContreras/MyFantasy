# Fantasy Football Lineup Optimizer - Project Guide

## Project Overview
Build a comprehensive NFL fantasy football web application with AI-powered lineup optimization, featuring a glass morphism UI design, real-time player analysis, and multi-platform league integration.

## Important: MCP Integrations
**This project uses two Model Context Protocol servers:**

### 1. shadcn MCP
- For rapid UI component development
- Direct access to shadcn/ui components
- Generate custom component variants on demand

### 2. Playwright MCP ðŸŽ­
- Browser automation for web scraping NFL data
- Automated league imports from ESPN/Yahoo/Sleeper/CBS
- End-to-end testing with screenshots
- Real-time data extraction from sports sites

MCP Usage Tips:
- **shadcn**: "Add shadcn button component" or "Create GlassCard variant"
- **Playwright**: "Scrape NFL stats from ESPN" or "Automate Yahoo league import"

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui (with MCP)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express/Next.js API routes
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js (Email/Password + Google OAuth)
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts, D3.js
- **NFL Data**: ESPN API, nfl-api-client, Playwright MCP for scraping
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI API for analysis, TensorFlow.js for predictions
- **Real-time**: Socket.io for live updates
- **Caching**: Redis for API response caching
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright MCP for E2E
- **Web Automation**: Playwright MCP for scraping and league imports
- **Component Library**: shadcn/ui with MCP integration for rapid development

## Quick Start with MCP Advantages

### Why This Project Will Be Faster with MCPs:
1. **shadcn MCP**: No manual component coding - generate UI instantly
2. **Playwright MCP**: No complex scraping setup - direct browser automation
3. **Combined Power**: Test your UI while scraping data in real-time

### First Commands to Run with Claude Code:
```bash
# 1. Start the project
"Initialize the Next.js project as specified in Task 1.1"

# 2. Setup glass morphism UI
"Use shadcn MCP to create the glass morphism theme and base components"

# 3. Test data scraping
"Use Playwright MCP to navigate to ESPN NFL stats and show me what data we can extract"

# 4. Create your first component
"Create a GlassCard component using shadcn Card with glass morphism effects"
```

3. **Testing**: Use Playwright MCP for comprehensive E2E testing
4. **Monitoring**: Use Playwright MCP to watch for data updates

### Development Notes
1. **Start Small**: Begin with Phase 1 and test each component before moving forward
2. **MCP First**: Always use MCPs (shadcn/Playwright) before writing from scratch
3. **Mock Data**: Use mock data initially to test UI before API integration
4. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling at each step
5. **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript for all data models
6. **Component Library**: Build reusable components early using shadcn as base
7. **API Limits**: Implement rate limiting and caching to respect API limits
8. **Testing**: Write tests as you build, not after
9. **Screenshots**: Use Playwright MCP to document UI states and data imports

## Commands to Run
```bash
# After each phase, run:
npm run dev  # Test locally
npm run build  # Ensure builds succeed
npm run test  # Run test suite
npx prisma migrate dev  # Update database
```

This project is designed to be built incrementally. Each task builds upon the previous one, ensuring a stable foundation for this complex application.
